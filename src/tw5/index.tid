This [[tank]]@docs includes an `app` that provides a form
of [TiddlyWiki5](http://tiddlywiki.com) suitable for use in
a [[composition]]@docs.

For the time being this is experimental, not least because
tw5 is itself, especially operating with TiddlyWeb@docs, still a bit
of an experiment.

To use this comp, create a tank in which you will keep your tw5 content
and then create a comp (see the nearby command) with that tank. When
you visit the comp you will be presented with a tw5 in which you 
can create and edit content.
