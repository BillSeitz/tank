When a new [[tiddler]] is created in a tank, by default the syntax of its text
is [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics). In addition
to the basic forms for making headers, paragraphs, lists, links and images
the Markdown used also has support for some additional features:

* [fenced
  code](http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/fenced_code_blocks.html)
* [definition
  lists](http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/definition_lists.html)
* [foootnotes](http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/footnotes.html)
* [header
  ids](http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/header_id.html)
* [interactive checklists](https://github.com/FND/markdown-checklist)
  that save their checked state back to the tiddler.
* Wiki links and transclusions, described below.

Go to the [basic
documentation](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) for
a reference on the standard features.

Links between tiddlers in a single tank and between tiddlers in different
tanks are possible. There are three styles of links:

* Wiki links that use `CamelCase` (links to a tiddler named `CamelCase`)
* Free links that use a `[[bracket syntax]]` (links to a tiddler named
  `bracket syntax`)
* Labelled links: `[[label|target]]` (links to a tiddler named
  `target` with a link title of `label`)

Each of these links styles can have `@<name of tank>` appended to link to
the named tiddler in the named tank. For example `CowHouse@foobar` would
link to the tiddler named `CowHouse` in the tank named `foobar`.

**Note**: `CamelCase` style linking does not play well with the default
style of linking used in Markdown (e.g. `[title](target)`). It is best to
not put `CamelCase` words within the title text, the results can be a
bit odd.

Tiddlers may also be transcluded into another. This means that one tiddler
sucks in and presents the content of another tiddler within itself. The basic
syntax is, _on a line by itself_:

```
{{tiddler title}}
```

As above, an `@<name of tank>` can be appended (outside the `}}`) to transclude
from a different tank. If the current user cannot read from the other tank
the transclusion will not happen.

In the default tank editing interface, you can extract text from the current
tiddler into a new one that is then transcluded into the current one. This
process is caused "extraclusion" and is driven by some special syntax that
surrounds the text that is to be extracluded:

```
Main content

.extraclude newTitle

Extracluded content

.extraclude
```

When this content is saved, the original tiddler's text will be:

```
Main content

{{newTitle}}
```

and newTitle will contain:

```

Extracluded content

```

Multiple extraclusions can be in one document.

This can be a very powerful editing tool but should be used with plenty of care
and thought.
