When a new tiddler is created in a tank, by default the syntax of its text
is [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics). In addition
to the basic forms for making headers, paragraphs, lists and links the
Markdown used also has support for some additional features:

* [fenced
  code](http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/fenced_code_blocks.html)
* [definition
  lists](http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/definition_lists.html)
* [foootnotes](http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/footnotes.html)
* [header
  ids](http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/header_id.html)
* [interactive checklists](https://github.com/FND/markdown-checklist)
  that save their checked state back to the tiddler.
* Wiki links and transclusions, described below.

Links between tiddlers in a single tank and between tiddlers in different
tanks are possible. There are three styles of links:

* Wiki links that use `CamelCase` (links to a tiddler named `CamelCase`)
* Free links that use a `[[bracket syntax]]` (links to a tiddler named
  `bracket syntax`)
* Labelled links: `[[label|target]]` (links to a tiddler named
  `target` with a link title of `label`)

Each of these links styles can have `@<name of tank>` appended to link to
the named tiddler in the named tank. For example `CowHouse@foobar` would
link to the tiddler named `CowHouse` in the tank named `foobar`.

**Note**: `CamelCase` style linking does not play well with the default
style of linking used in Markdown (e.g. `[title](target)`). It is best to
not put `CamelCase` words within the title text, the results can be a
bit odd.

Tiddlers may also be transcluded into another. This means that one tiddler
sucks in and presents the content of another tiddler within itself. The basic
syntax is, _on a line by itself_:

```
{{tiddler title}}
```

As above, an `@<name of tank>` can be appended (outside the `}}`) to transclude
from a different tank. If the current user cannot read from the other tank
the transclusion will not happen.
