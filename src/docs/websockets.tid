Tank has a websocket server that broadcasts messages about
[[tiddlers|tiddler]] in [[tanks|tank]] which are publicly readable.
This server is used to provide activity notifications on many pages and
can also be used in [[comps|composition]] and
[[single page apps|Single Page Apps]].

On common pages, the header now has two new icons: A straight mouth face
and a clear bell.

When the clear bell turns white that means at least one new public
tiddler was just created. Clicking on the bell will reveal a little
dropdown listing up to five recent tiddlers. The title is a link to the
tiddler. Clicking on it will visit the tiddler. Clicking elsewhere
in the dropdown will close it.

When the face turns into a smile, a new tiddler has been created which
is tagged `@<yourusername>`. This signals to you that someone has
created a tiddler for which they'd like your attention. You can click
on the face, open the dropdown and follow the link to see what they
have to say.

The websocket interface can also be used in custom code to get
notifications of tiddlers. Look at the following to see how the features
described above work and adapt accordingly:

* [socketinfo.js](https://tank.peermore.com/tanks/tank/socketinfo.js)
* [tiddlersocket.js](https://tank.peermore.com/tanks/tank/tiddlersocket.js)

Looking at the source of any page, such as the [frontpage](/), will reveal
how the scripts are called and other requirements.
