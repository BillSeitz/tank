The mover is a tool which makes it easy to move a [[tiddler]] from
one [[tank]] to another.

To use the mover you must be able to create tiddlers in the target tank
_and_ there must not be a tiddler of the same name in the target.

When clicked, an interface will be revealed presenting a selection of
available bags.
