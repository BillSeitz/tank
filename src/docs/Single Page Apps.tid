A [single page
application](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_page_application) (or SPA)
is a page of HTML which includes or loads all the necessary CSS and Javascript
to enable a set of application behaviors.

Tank makes an ideal host for single page applications because you can
host both the application (and its assets) _and_ the data or content
that the application uses in the same place. Accessing and managing
the data is done over the [[API]].

You can make an SPA in two ways:

* Putting the HTML and other files in a tank and then accessing the
  HTML file directly.
* Creating a [[tank]] where the main HTML file is named `app` and
  necessary assets are kept in the same tank. Then use that tank in
  a [[comp|composition]].
