Tank is built on top of [TiddlyWeb](http://tiddlyweb.com). This
means that all the API features available in [TiddlyWeb](http://tiddlyweb.com)
are available in Tank. Using the API you can:

* create additional [[tanks|tank]]
* manage the [policies](http://tiddlyweb.tiddlyspace.com/policy) on tanks
* create and edit [[comps|composition]]
* add [[tiddler]] content to your tanks

You can visit entry points for the API at [/bags](/bags) and
[/recipes](/recipes). All tanks are made up of one bag. All
comps are made up of one recipe.

The reason for the different names is that not all bags are tanks and
not all recipes are comps.

To learn more about the API see the [official
documentation](http://tiddlyweb.tiddlyspace.com/HTTP%20API).
