The twinner is a tool which makes it easy to create a [[tiddler]] in
your home tank with the same name as the one you are currently reading.

Your home [[tank]] is the tank named after your username.

The interface is only presented when you are logged in and not in your
home tank.

When clicked, an interface will be revealed presenting a textarea
and a tag interface. If the target tiddler already exists, its text
and tags will be shown available for editing. Otherwise the textarea shows
a link back to the current tiddler and the tags are configured to notify
the modifier of the current tiddler that you have made a twin.

When confirm is clicked, the tiddler is saved and you will be redirected
there.
