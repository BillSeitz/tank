A composition, or comp, combines two or more tanks to achieve 
an alternate presentation or tool for managing the content in
the tanks.

In one of the tanks in the comp there must be a tiddler called `app`.
When the comp is loaded, the `app` tiddler is loaded and used
as the HTML starting point of a [[single page app|Single Page Apps]].

This is the mechanism that supports using things like loading
tiddlers in a [TiddlyWiki](http://tiddlywiki.com).

At this time there are two ways to create a composition. One, advanced,
option is to use the [[API]] to create a recipe. The other works as
follows:

* Visit your [dashboard](/dash) and follow one of the links in
  Available Compositions.
* Using the "This tank is composable" interface, choose a name
  and tank to compose with.

The comp that is created will be owned by you. If the tank you compose
with is readable by others then the comp you create will be visible
to them in lists such as [recipes](/recipes). Creating and editing
content is dependent on the policies of the tank you choose.
