Tank is free to use in limited quantities. Every user gets access to basic
functionality. Eventually, after a period of testing, extended functionality
will require a low subscription fee. This fee will be used to offset
the costs of hosting and secure time for continued development.

Details on how subscription will be handled, for example how much it will cost,
are yet to be decided. If you have comments or concerns, please [[contact]]
us.
