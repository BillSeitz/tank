The [policy manager](/policymgr) is available to logged in
users to manage the [policies](http://tiddlyweb.tiddlyspace.com/policy)
on their [[tanks|tank]]. It is used to add or remove users
from the policies controlling who can read, write, create or delete
tiddlers in the tank and who can manage those policies.

_The policy manager is a dangerous tool. Used incorrectly it is possible
to be locked out of a tank. Please make sure you have a full understanding
of [policies](http://tiddlyweb.tiddlyspace.com/policy)._

The current interface is experimental and will be improved based on
feedback. Please [[contact us|contact]] or leave an
[issue](https://github.com/cdent/tank/issues)

The general principle is to click on a tank to view its settings. Clicking
on the pencil icon will then reveal a form where values can be changed. In
the policy constraints usernames are (for the time being) separated by
commas. Clicking the X will cancel changes. Clicking the checkmark
will save the changes.

You may also delete any tank from the list which has an associated trash
can. This will delete the tank **and all the tiddlers within.**
