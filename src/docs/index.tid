Tank is a service for creating, keeping, managing and sharing content
of all sorts online in an environment that encourages linking between
things to build hypertextual webs of information.

Tank is built on [TiddlyWeb](http://tiddlyweb.com), a robust HTTP [[API]]
for [[tiddlers|tiddler]]. Because of this, your content can be of any sort
and be accessed in many different ways.

Tiddlers are kept in [[tanks|tank]] and tanks can be augmented with
[[comps|composition]].
