# About Tank

Tank is a service for creating, keeping, managing and sharing content
of all sorts online in an environment that encourages linking between
things to build hypertextual webs of information.

Tank is built on TiddlyWeb, a robust HTTP [[API]] for [[tiddlers|tiddler]]. 
Because of this, your content can be of any sort and be accessed in many
different ways. See examples of [[Content Types]] and access
[[Representations]].
