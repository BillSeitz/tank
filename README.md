Tiddlers Are N[eo][tw] Knowledge

* Net Knowledge: reach it.
* Now Knowledge: access it.
* New Knowledge: create it.
* Not Knowledge: use it.

Knowledge is only in the head, so any tiddler on the net is information,
but if you can reach it and access it then you can make it knowlege.

I've started building some of the pieces that could be used for a
tank-like thing. At the moment simply experimenting with:

* [tiddlywebplugins.oauth](https://github.com/cdent/tiddlywebplugins.oauth)
  to use GitHub for auth and registration.
* [tiddlywebplugins.templates](https://github.com/tiddlyweb/tiddlywebplugins.templates)
  to control presentation of output.
* [tiddlywebplugins.devstore2](https://github.com/tiddlyweb/tiddlywebplugins.devstore2)
  to do in repo development against assets

The goal is to discover issues throughout the entire plugin stack.

A [demo site](https://tank.peermore.com/) is available for testing.
