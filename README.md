Tiddlers Are N[eo][tw] Knowledge

* Net Knowledge: reach it.
* Now Knowledge: access it.
* New Knowledge: create it.
* Not Knowledge: use it.

Knowledge is only in the head, so any tiddler on the net is information,
but if you can reach it and access it then you can make it knowlege.

I'm intentionally developing this with a lack of test discipline. I'll explain
why eventually.
